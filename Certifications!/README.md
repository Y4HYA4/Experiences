<details> <summary> Points to consider in the near future </summary>
<br>

Even after the great Microsoft marathon, my thirst for knowledge and desire to stay up-to-date with technology has not waned. In fact, I am now turning my focus to learn more about Amazon Web Services (AWS) and cloud native technologies.

I believe that having a diverse skill set is essential in today's fast-paced and constantly evolving tech industry, and I see such experience is an important step in my professional development.

Aditionnaly, as a full remote, I'm interested in Microsoft 365 and the security of the modern workplace. So I'm going to put a lot of effort and experience into that, and I'll have more Microsoft certifications to work on as well.

I am confident that the skills and knowledge I'll gain further will be invaluable in my career and will help me to better serve the world.
