<summary> Why I take too much exams? </summary>
<br>
Let me share with you why I take certifications and the value they have brought to my career and personal life.
<br><br>

**First and foremost**, I take certifications because they allow me to demonstrate my skills and expertise in a particular technology or subject matter.

If you do not choose an area of interest and devote countless hours to it, someone else will decide what you must do. I cannot guarantee that this will be a pleasant experience. It's not just about the cloud. 

Simply pick your passion.

It happened to be the great cloud for my case.

As such having certifications **can** set you apart from other candidates and show potential employers that you have the knowledge and dedication required to succeed in the cloud. 

Yeah, Life is very competitive.
<br>
<br>

Further, preparing for certs all the time have helped me to stay creative and be thirsty to learn more and provide values. 

It is important to constantly learn and adapt, and certifications provide a <b>structured way</b> for me to do so.

<br>

**Being examined** have also helped me to grow as a person. 
- Earning a certification requires hard work, dedication, and a willingness to constantly challenge myself and face my fears which literally fades in growth. 

These traits are not only valuable in my career, but in all aspects of my life.ðŸŽ¯

[Earl Nightingale](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cnw3Elcqms3/) once said that the more intensely we feel about an idea or a goal, the more assuredly the idea, buried deep in our subconscious, will direct us along the path to its fulfillment.

<summary> Are certifications pointless? </summary>
<br>

Those who claim that certifications do not matter either possess few or no certifications themselves and are attempting to emphasize the importance of their personal experience. While we certainly value experiences, it is also important to recognize that obtaining new certifications can broaden one's skillset and facilitate personal and professional growth. 
<br>
<br>
Consider the adage: are you having years of experiences or repeating the same year over and over?
<br>
<br>
Certs are a form of self-growth and my advice is to ignore most people because they do not have your best interests at heart.

<summary> I am a GitHub graduate - Class 2022 </summary>

I have had the opportunity to delve deep into the platform and learn everything it has to offer. From managing repositories and working with branches, to collaborating with others and contributing to open source projects, working with pipelines using Actoins, GitHub has provided me with the tools and resources I need to succeed as a developer.

Appreciate what GitHub has done for me and my career! I truly believe it is an invaluable platform for anyone interested in software development. Get in.
